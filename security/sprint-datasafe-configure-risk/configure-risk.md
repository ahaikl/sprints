# How do I adjust the risk level of a risk finding?

Duration: 2 minutes

After completing a security assessment in Data Safe you will be presented with a number of risk findings and their initial risk levels. Once you have taken appropriate actions to mitigate security risks on a target database based on the results of a security assessment, you can adjust the risk level of a finding. Adjustments of risk levels can be indefinite or have an expiration date.

1. Under **Security center**, click **Security assessment**.

    The **Security assessment details** page is displayed, showing you the latest assessment report for your target database.

    Once the risk level finishes updating you will see an indicator that the risk level for this finding has been modified.
